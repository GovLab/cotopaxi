    <p>The City of Quito, Ecuador needed help preparing for the <a href="https://www.wired.com/2015/08/cotopaxi-continues-rumble-ecuador-prepares-eruption/"  class="recommendation-links"  target="_blank">likely eruption of the Cotopaxi Volcano</a> situated 30 miles from Quito. The last large-scale eruption was in 1877, and it is believed that another one is now inevitable. If it erupts, some communities will have less than half an hour to evacuate. The scale of the challenge is overwhelming. Smarter Crowdsourcing: Cotopaxi convened those with good ideas for how to mitigate the risks, especially using technology and innovation.</p>
