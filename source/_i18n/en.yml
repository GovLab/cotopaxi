    In a series of weekly, 2-hour web-based conferences, experts from around the world will discuss innovative and practical ways to tackle the root causes of Zika and mosquito-borne diseases. These small-group discussions are intended to foster brainstorming of actionable new strategies in conversation with those government officials responsible for managing the outbreaks.

    <p>Cotopaxi Volcano lies 30 miles away from Quito. In August 2015, the volcano began spewing ash after 72 years of being in an inactive stage. Cotopaxi’s awakening is no good news. Currently, the scale of the challenge is overwhelming. The magnitude of a possible eruption has surprised citizens, local and national authorities alike.</p>
    <p>The most preoccupying factor related to Cotopaxi’s possible eruption is the fact that lava would melt the volcano’s glaciers, creating lahars (masses of hot and cold rock) that would increase the water flow in rivers to dangerous levels, causing massive mud floods. If the eruption occurs, nearby communities will only have 30-40 minutes to find shelter. The immediate challenge is that there are 120,000 people in the valley beneath the volcano who will have little time to evacuate the risk areas; especially those areas in the direct paths of the incoming lahars. More than 325,000 people in total will be at near-term risk.</p>
    <p>It is under such circumstances that Linq, the innovation lab at the Municipality of Quito, with the active support of The GovLab, turned to people with relevant know-how and expertise related to disaster preparation and, most importantly, people with good, innovative and techie ideas on how to mitigate potential risks. The collaboration scheme involved crowdsourcing wisely, not necessarily widely.</p>
    <p>In order to crowdsource expertise, a set of meetings were carried out with the intention to better define and understand the nature of the problem; help connect those people with relevant experience and know how to city officials to help Quito better manage the impending disaster; identify innovative and practical ways, especially using new technology, to tackle the challenge at hand; and, last but not least, find out ways to do things differently and potentially save lives by optimizing resources and financing solutions for the ow for money to be spent on what matters most.</p>
